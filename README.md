# Power Query Practice Work

My personal collection of Power Query practice exercises and projects. This repository is dedicated to exploring and mastering various data transformation, cleaning, and M-language techniques within Power Query.

### üéØ **Project Goal**
The main purpose of this repository is to serve as a practical portfolio of my skills in Power Query. Each file represents a different data challenge and demonstrates how to use Power Query to solve it efficiently, from simple tasks to more complex data manipulation scenarios.

### üìÇ **Topics Covered**
This repository includes projects covering a wide range of Power Query functionalities, such as:

* **Combining and Appending Data:** Merging multiple tables and workbooks, including dynamic folder data.
* **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Handling raw data, removing unwanted rows, and standardizing data formats.
* **Date and Time Calculations:** Calculating age, finding working days, and determining task durations.
* **Advanced Merging Techniques:** Performing multi-column lookups and merges using M-language.
* **Handling Raw Data:** Structured approaches to managing and maintaining records from messy or unformatted sources.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How to Use**
Each Excel file contains raw data and the corresponding Power Query steps. To view the solution:

1.  Download the Excel file you want to examine.
2.  Open the file and go to the "Data" tab.
3.  Click on "Queries & Connections" to open the Power Query pane.
4.  Double-click the query to see the applied steps in the Power Query Editor.

### üöÄ **Future Plans**
I will continue to update this repository with new practice files and projects as I learn and work on more advanced Power Query challenges.
